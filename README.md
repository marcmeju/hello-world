# hello-world

I am Marcel. I learned the Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. 
It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. 

I know JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

I am just getting started with posting my work on GitHub! 

This should be fun!
